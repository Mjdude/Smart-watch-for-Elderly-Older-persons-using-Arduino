The Arduino Nano-based Heart Rate Monitoring System for Elders is an
innovative project designed to provide a reliable and user-friendly
solution for monitoring the heart rate of elderly individuals. This
project aims to assist caregivers, medical professionals, and family
members in monitoring the cardiac health of their loved ones
conveniently and effectively. The core component of this system is the
Arduino Nano microcontroller, a compact and powerful device that
enables the integration of various sensors and modules. The heart rate
sensor, an essential component, is connected to the Arduino Nano and
is responsible for detecting and measuring the heart rate of the
user.The Arduino Nano's compact size and low power consumption
make the system portable and ideal for monitoring heart rates on the
go. The data collected by the system can also be logged and stored for
further analysis or shared with healthcare professionals for
comprehensive monitoring and evaluationThe Arduino Nano-based
Heart Rate Monitoring System for Elders not only enhances the ease of
monitoring cardiac health but also promotes independence and peace
of mind for both the elderly individuals and their caregivers. It serves
as an invaluable tool in ensuring the well-being and timely intervention
when required, contributing to a healthier and more secure lifestyle
for the elderly population.
